# ImgFetcher

Welcome to your new gem! In this directory, you'll find the files you need to be able to package up your Ruby library into a gem. Put your Ruby code in the file `lib/img_fetcher`. To experiment with that code, run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'img_fetcher'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle install

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install img_fetcher

## Usage

TODO: Write usage instructions here

## Downloading file from URL

Regarding the download of files from a URL, the first approach will be using `open-uri`, 
but knowing that this input will be generated by external users, `open-uri` has some 
[limitations and security issues](https://janko.io/improving-open-uri/) if it's nothandled 
carefully. After doing some research, [Down](https://github.com/janko/down) gem takes care of all 
these issues for you, as well as valid URL, file size, timeouts, number of redirects, connectivity, 
and more.

For this case, we limit the **maximum number of redirects to 0** and **there's no limit about the file size**. Looking for an improvement, both can be added as a command-line option in a future.

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
